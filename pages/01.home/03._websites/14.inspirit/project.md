 This is Inspir.it, a web application for internet inspiration; a visual medium that stores website links, names, descriptions and an associated category and color. All you have to do is fill out a form, conveniently placed on the frontpage, hit submit, and your website and color selection will dynamically appear in a grid that you can scroll through!
