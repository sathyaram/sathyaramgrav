The FÃ¼dTruk is a mobile culinary unit on Lehigh University Campus that uses locally sourced food to make killer sandwiches, breakfast and lunch and unique dishes. I had the opportunity to completely brand them, from their logo, to the color scheme, to the vinyl wrap for the truck, and to their website.
