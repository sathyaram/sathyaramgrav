While at Lehigh, I had the honor of redesigning Lehigh's Engineering College website. Starting from the ground up, I created a vibrant, contemporary aesthetic with should surely catch the eye of a new budding engineer as well as push the limits for how collegiate websites should look and function. A lot of thought and time went into all of it.
