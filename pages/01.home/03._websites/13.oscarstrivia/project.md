This is a single player trivia game based on the 2018 Academy Awards (The Oscars). It tests your Oscars knowledge on at two level: a 10 question quiz testing the most popular Oscars categories: definitely casual movie watchers, or and the 24 question challenge on all the Oscars award categories for the know-it-alls out there.
