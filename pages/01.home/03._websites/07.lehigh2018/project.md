I created Lehigh University's Official 2018 Theme that is set to be used across over 150 websites. It was a personal and exhilerating project that required a lot of research, reiterating, and understanding. But I was able get a flexible, scalable, lightweight, theme out that would bring Lehigh out of their old theme created in 2012.
