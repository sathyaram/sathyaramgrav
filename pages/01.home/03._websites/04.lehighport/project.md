While at Lehigh University, I was Portal administrator and had the chance to completely redesign how it looked and functioned. I surveyed students, staff, faculty and all stakeholders of the original Portal to see what all needed improving. I used data driven decision-making and analytics to create a realistic user experience for popular links, tool and resources - I designed it to be more practical and modern for the user. My Portal redesign was also graced with PABUG's best college portal redesign for 2017.
